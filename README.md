# sendspin

> **Note:** This project is a fork of the original Sendspin client, extended with additional features such as a local real-time HTTP control API.

[![pypi_badge](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sendspin.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sendspin)

Connect to any [Sendspin](https://www.sendspin-audio.com) server and instantly turn your computer into an audio target that can participate in multi-room audio.

Sendspin CLI includes three apps:

- **[`sendspin`](#quick-start)** - Terminal client for interactive use
- **[`sendspin daemon`](#daemon-mode)** - Background daemon for headless devices
- **[`sendspin serve`](#sendspin-party)** - Host a Sendspin party to demo Sendspin

When using an explicit app (`daemon`, `serve`, or `player`), put it immediately after
`sendspin`. For example, use `sendspin daemon --name Kitchen`, not
`sendspin --name Kitchen daemon`.

## Installation

**Install as daemon (Linux):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sendspin/sendspin-cli/refs/heads/main/scripts/systemd/install-systemd.sh | sudo bash
```

**With uv:**
```bash
uv tool install sendspin
```

Support for Chromecast devices requires installation of extra dependencies:
```bash
uv tool install 'sendspin[cast]'
```

**With pip:**
```bash
pip install sendspin
```

## Try it without installation

**Run directly with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):**

Start client

```bash
uvx sendspin
```

Host a Sendspin party

```bash
uvx sendspin serve --demo
uvx sendspin serve /path/to/media.mp3
uvx sendspin serve https://retro.dancewave.online/retrodance.mp3
```

## Daemon Control API
Daemon mode can optionally expose a local HTTP API:

```bash
sendspin daemon --control-api true --control-host 127.0.0.1 --control-port 59999
```
Security Warning: This API is unauthenticated. Ensure you only bind it to trusted local loopback interfaces (e.g., 127.0.0.1) to prevent unauthorized network access.

### `GET /state`
Returns the current real-time playback state, track metadata, and hardware volume. The track position uses hardware hooks and extrapolation to maintain millisecond accuracy dynamically between server payload frames.

Response Example:

```JSON
{
  "track": {
    "title": "Breaker Breaker",
    "artist": "Peter Bjorn and John",
    "album": "Writer's Block",
    "artwork_url": "https://..."
  },
  "playback": {
    "position": 42.105,
    "duration": 185.0,
    "speed": 1.0
  },
  "volume": {
    "volume": 75,
    "muted": false
  },
  "delay_ms": 50.0,
  "audio": {
    "released": false,
    "stream_active": true
  }
}
```

### `POST /control`
Accepts a JSON payload to securely send playback and volume commands to the active server.

#### Supported Commands:

- `{"command": "play"}`
- `{"command": "pause"}`
- `{"command": "toggle_play_pause"}`
- `{"command": "next"}`
- `{"command": "previous"}`
- `{"command": "set_volume", "volume": 50, "muted": false}` (0-100)
- `{"command": "set_delay", "delay_ms": 50}` (0-5000)
- `{"command": "release_audio"}` closes the local audio stream and drops incoming chunks so another process can use the device
- `{"command": "acquire_audio"}` resumes local audio output on the configured device
- `{"command": "audio_status"}` returns the current local audio output status

#### Request Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:59999/control \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"command": "toggle_play_pause"}'
```

For integrations that temporarily need exclusive access to the audio device,
pause playback before releasing audio, then acquire audio before starting
Sendspin playback again.

## Updating

To update to the latest version of Sendspin:

**If installed with uv:**
```bash
uv tool upgrade sendspin
```

**If installed with pip:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade sendspin
```

**If installed as systemd daemon:**

The systemd daemon preserves your configuration during updates. Simply upgrade the package:

```bash
# Upgrade sendspin (the daemon installer uses uv by default)
uv tool upgrade sendspin

# Restart the service to use the new version
sudo systemctl restart sendspin
```

Your client name, audio device selection, and other settings in `~/.config/sendspin/settings-daemon.json` are preserved during the update.

> **Note:** You do **not** need to uninstall and reinstall when updating. Your configuration (client name, audio device, delay settings) is stored separately and will be preserved.

## Configuration Options

Sendspin stores settings in JSON configuration files that persist between sessions. All command-line arguments can also be set in the config file, with CLI arguments taking precedence over stored settings.

### Configuration File

Settings are stored in `~/.config/sendspin/`:
- `settings-tui.json` - Settings for the interactive TUI client
- `settings-daemon.json` - Settings for daemon mode
- `settings-serve.json` - Settings for serve mode

**Example configuration file (TUI/daemon):**
```json
{
  "player_volume": 50,
  "player_muted": false,
  "static_delay_ms": 0,
  "last_server_url": "ws://192.168.1.100:8927/sendspin",
  "name": "Living Room",
  "client_id": "sendspin-living-room",
  "audio_device": "2",
  "audio_format": "flac:48000:24:2",
  "log_level": "INFO",
  "listen_port": 8927,
  "use_mpris": true,
  "use_hardware_volume": true,
  "hook_set_volume": "/usr/local/bin/set-avr-volume",
  "manufacturer": "Acme Corp",
  "product_name": "Living Room Speaker",
  "interface": "192.168.1.5"
}
```

**Example configuration file (serve):**
```json
{
  "log_level": "INFO",
  "listen_port": 8927,
  "name": "My Sendspin Server",
  "source": "/path/to/music.mp3",
  "clients": ["ws://192.168.1.50:8927/sendspin", "ws://192.168.1.51:8927/sendspin"]
}
```

**Available settings:**

| Setting | Type | Mode | Description |
|---------|------|------|-------------|
| `player_volume` | integer (0-100) | TUI/daemon | Player output volume percentage |
| `player_muted` | boolean | TUI/daemon | Whether the player is muted |
| `static_delay_ms` | float | TUI/daemon | Extra playback delay in milliseconds |
| `last_server_url` | string | TUI/daemon | Server URL (used as default for `--url`) |

| `hook_set_volume` | string | TUI/daemon | Script to run for external volume control (`--hook-set-volume`). Receives the effective volume 0-100 as the last argument |
| `hook_start` | string | TUI/daemon | Command to run when audio stream starts |
| `hook_stop` | string | TUI/daemon | Command to run when audio stream stops |
| `manufacturer` | string | TUI/daemon | Manufacturer name reported in the client hello (`--manufacturer`) |
| `product_name` | string | TUI/daemon | Product name reported in the client hello (`--product-name`); defaults to auto-detected OS/platform name |
| `interface` | string | TUI/daemon | IP address of the network interface to use (`--interface`) |
| `visualizer` | boolean | TUI | Render the `visualizer@v1` audio visualizer on launch (default: false). Toggle with `v` in the TUI |

| `source_format` | string | serve | ffmpeg container format for audio source |
| `clients` | array | serve | Client URLs to connect to (`--client`) |

Settings are automatically saved when changed through the TUI. You can also edit the JSON file directly while the client is not running.

### Server Connection

By default, the player automatically discovers Sendspin servers on your local network using mDNS. You can also connect directly to a specific server:

```bash
sendspin --url ws://192.168.1.100:8080/sendspin
```

**List available servers on the network:**
```bash
sendspin servers list
```

### Client Identification

If you want to run multiple players on the **same computer**, you can specify unique identifiers:

```bash
sendspin --id my-client-1 --name "Kitchen"
sendspin --id my-client-2 --name "Bedroom"
```

- `--id`: A unique identifier for this client (optional; defaults to `sendspin-<hostname>`, useful for running multiple instances on one computer)
- `--name`: A friendly name displayed on the server (optional; defaults to hostname)

### Audio Output Device Selection

By default, the player uses your system's default audio output device. You can list available devices or select a specific device:

**List available audio devices:**
```bash
sendspin audio-devices list
```

This displays all audio output devices with their IDs, channel configurations, and sample rates. The default device is marked.

**Select a specific audio device by index:**
```bash
sendspin --audio-device 2
```

**Or by name prefix:**
```bash
sendspin --audio-device "MacBook"
```

**Or by raw ALSA device name (Linux):**
```bash
sendspin --audio-device dmixer
```

This is useful for ALSA plugin devices (dmix, plug, etc.) that may not appear in the numbered PortAudio device list (though they may be shown in the ALSA devices section on Linux). For example, in a dual mono setup where two daemons share a single sound card via dmix, each daemon can target a different ALSA device that routes to a specific channel:

```bash
# Room 1: left channel via dmix
sendspin daemon --name "Living Room" --audio-device living_room

# Room 2: right channel via dmix
sendspin daemon --name "Kitchen" --audio-device kitchen
```

This requires an `/etc/asound.conf` with dmix and plug devices that route to the appropriate channels. See your ALSA documentation for details on configuring dmix.

This is particularly useful when running `sendspin daemon` on headless devices or when you want to route audio to a specific output.

### Preferred Audio Format

By default, the player negotiates the best audio format with the server from the list of formats supported by your audio device (preferring FLAC over PCM). You can specify a preferred format to prioritize:

```bash
sendspin --audio-format flac:48000:24:2
```

The format string uses the pattern `codec:sample_rate:bit_depth:channels`:
- **codec**: `flac` (compressed, preferred) or `pcm` (uncompressed)
- **sample_rate**: Sample rate in Hz (e.g., `44100`, `48000`, `96000`)
- **bit_depth**: Bits per sample (`16` or `24`)
- **channels**: Channel count (`1` for mono, `2` for stereo)

The specified format is validated against the audio device on startup. If the device doesn't support it, the player will exit with an error.

### System Volume Control

On Linux with PulseAudio/PipeWire, Sendspin can control your system output volume directly. Volume adjustments (keyboard shortcuts, server commands) change the system volume. The current system volume is read on startup — the `player_volume` and `player_muted` settings are only used when hardware volume is disabled.

Hardware volume is **on by default in daemon mode** and **off by default in TUI mode**. To override:

```bash
sendspin --hardware-volume true             # Enable for TUI
sendspin daemon --hardware-volume false     # Disable for daemon
```

If your real volume control lives on another device, you can hand volume changes off to a script instead:

```bash
sendspin daemon --hook-set-volume /usr/local/bin/set-avr-volume
```

The script receives the effective output volume as its last argument in the range `0-100`. When the player is muted, Sendspin calls the script with `0` and keeps the last logical `player_volume` persisted separately so unmuting restores the previous level.

Because Sendspin cannot read back external device state from the hook, startup volume comes from the persisted `player_volume` and `player_muted` settings. Those settings are updated whenever Sendspin successfully applies a new volume through the hook. When `hook_set_volume` is configured, it takes precedence over PulseAudio/PipeWire hardware volume control.

### Adjusting Playback Delay

The player supports adjusting playback delay to compensate for audio hardware latency or achieve better synchronization across devices.

```bash
sendspin --static-delay-ms 50
```

> **Note:** A delay of 0ms works well in most cases. If audio is playing slightly too late, a small positive delay (e.g., 50ms) can help compensate for audio hardware latency. On compatible servers, delay can be configured remotely per player, so you shouldn't need to set this locally.

### Daemon Mode

To run the player as a background daemon without the interactive TUI (useful for headless devices or scripts):

```bash
sendspin daemon
```

The daemon runs in the background and logs status messages to stdout. It accepts the same connection and audio options as the TUI client:

```bash
sendspin daemon --name "Kitchen" --audio-device 2
```

You can start the daemon without immediately acquiring the audio device (useful when
the device is already in use by another process or container). When started this way
Sendspin will not hold the audio device and can be instructed to acquire it later via
the control API.

```bash
sendspin daemon --release-audio-on-start --control-api true
```

Use the control API `{"command": "acquire_audio"}` to resume local audio output
when the device becomes available.

In daemon mode without `--url`, the client listens for incoming server connections and advertises itself via mDNS. The `--name` option (or `name` setting) is used as the friendly name in the mDNS advertisement, making it easy for servers to identify this client on the network.

Use `--manufacturer` and `--product-name` to override the device identity reported to the server in the client hello. This is useful when running the daemon in a container or on a custom device where the auto-detected OS name is not meaningful:

```bash
sendspin daemon --name "Living Room" --manufacturer "Acme" --product-name "Living Room Speaker"
```

### Daemon Control API

Daemon mode can expose a local HTTP API for integrations such as Kodi:

```bash
sendspin daemon --control-api true --control-host 127.0.0.1 --control-port 59999
```

The API accepts playback and local player volume commands at `POST /control`, and exposes current track/playback/volume state at `GET /state`. Bind this API only to trusted local interfaces.

### Hooks

You can run external commands when audio streams start or stop. This is useful for controlling amplifiers, lighting, or other home automation:

```bash
sendspin --hook-start "./turn_on_amp.sh" --hook-stop "./turn_off_amp.sh"
```

Or with inline commands:

```bash
sendspin daemon --hook-start "amixer set Master unmute" --hook-stop "amixer set Master mute"
```

`--hook-set-volume` is separate from these stream lifecycle hooks. It is intended for external volume controllers and receives the effective output volume as its last argument.

Hooks receive these environment variables:
- `SENDSPIN_EVENT` - Event type: "start" or "stop"
- `SENDSPIN_SERVER_ID` - Connected server identifier
- `SENDSPIN_SERVER_NAME` - Connected server friendly name
- `SENDSPIN_SERVER_URL` - Connected server URL. Only available if client initiated the connection to the server.
- `SENDSPIN_CLIENT_ID` - Client identifier
- `SENDSPIN_CLIENT_NAME` - Client friendly name

### Visualizer

The TUI includes a real-time audio visualizer driven by the `visualizer@v1` role. All analysis is computed on the server and streamed to the TUI, time-aligned to the audio playhead. It shows:

- **Spectrum bars** — frequency magnitude across the range, tinted by overall loudness (and by the album-artwork palette when the server provides one).
- **Beats timeline** — a `beats (NNN BPM):` strip with the estimated tempo; downbeats render differently from regular beats.
- **Peaks timeline** — a `peaks:` strip of energy onsets (transients like drum hits), independent of the beat grid, with glyph height scaled by onset strength.
- **Pitch** — the perceived musical note (e.g. `A4`) with an arrow pointing at its position on the spectrum, shown whenever a pitch is detected.
- **Dominant frequency** — an `f_peak:` readout with an arrow marking the loudest frequency on the spectrum.

Lower rows are dropped first on short terminals, keeping the spectrum visible.

Toggle the visualizer by pressing `v` in the TUI. Your preference is saved in settings and remembered on next launch.

### Debugging & Troubleshooting

If you experience synchronization issues or audio glitches, you can enable detailed logging to help diagnose the problem:

```bash
sendspin --log-level DEBUG
```

This provides detailed information about time synchronization. The output can be helpful when reporting issues.

### Network Interface Binding

On machines with multiple network interfaces (e.g., a home server with both a LAN and a WAN/internet interface), you can restrict Sendspin to a specific interface using `--interface`:

```bash
sendspin --interface 192.168.1.5
sendspin daemon --interface 192.168.1.5
```

The `--interface` option takes the **IP address** of the interface to use. This affects:

- **mDNS discovery**: only servers advertising on that interface will be found.
- **Daemon listening mode** (no `--url`): the incoming-connection server binds only to that IP, so servers on other interfaces (e.g., the WAN) cannot connect.

This is useful when you want Sendspin to be accessible only on your LAN, not on the internet-facing interface.

## Install as Daemon (systemd, Linux)

For headless devices like Raspberry Pi, you can install `sendspin daemon` as a systemd service that starts automatically on boot.

**Install:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sendspin/sendspin-cli/refs/heads/main/scripts/systemd/install-systemd.sh | sudo bash
```

The installer will:
- Check and offer to install dependencies (libportaudio2, uv)
- Install sendspin via `uv tool install`
- Prompt for client name and audio device selection
- Create systemd service and configuration

**Manage the service:**
```bash
sudo systemctl start sendspin    # Start the service
sudo systemctl stop sendspin     # Stop the service
sudo systemctl status sendspin   # Check status
journalctl -u sendspin -f        # View logs
```

**Configuration:** Edit `~/.config/sendspin/settings-daemon.json` to change client name, audio device, or other settings.

**Uninstall:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sendspin/sendspin-cli/refs/heads/main/scripts/systemd/uninstall-systemd.sh | sudo bash
```

## Sendspin Party

The Sendspin client includes a mode to enable hosting a Sendspin Party. This will start a Sendspin server playing a specified audio file or URL in a loop, allowing nearby Sendspin clients to connect and listen together. It also hosts a web interface for easy playing and sharing. Fire up that home or office 🔥

```bash
# Demo mode
sendspin serve --demo
# Local file
sendspin serve /path/to/media.mp3
# Remote URL
sendspin serve https://retro.dancewave.online/retrodance.mp3
# Without pre-installing Sendspin
uvx sendspin serve /path/to/media.mp3
# Connect to specific clients
sendspin serve --demo --client ws://192.168.1.50:8927/sendspin --client ws://192.168.1.51:8927/sendspin
```

### Multi-Worker Mode

For serving many concurrent listeners, use `--workers` to run multiple server processes behind a reverse proxy:

```bash
sendspin serve --demo --workers 4
```

This spawns 4 worker processes on consecutive ports starting from `--port` (default 8927), so ports 8927-8930. Place a reverse proxy (e.g., nginx, Caddy) in front with load balancing across these ports.

Note: `--client` is not supported with `--workers`.
